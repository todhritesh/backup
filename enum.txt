in c programming an enumration type (also called enum ) is a data type that consist inegral constnts . To define enum
enum key is used
----


enum flag {const1 , const 2 ..............const3}

by default const 1 is 0 , const 2 is 1 and so on. You can change the default value of enum during declearation 
	enum data{
		club =0
		room = 49
		table =20
		}

#Enum type declearation

	when you define an enum type the w print for the variable is created . here how you can crate variable of enum type 
	
	enum boolean {true, false}
	enum boolean check //variable decleared
	enum boolean {true, false}check;
	here a variable check of type enum variable is created and here the value of false is equal to 0 and the value of 
	true = 1 .
